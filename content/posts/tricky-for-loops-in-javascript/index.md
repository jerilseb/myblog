If you have been to a frontend interview, you've probably been asked some variation of the below question.

**What will be the output of the following code snippet?**

```javascript
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log(i);
    }, 0);
}
```

You manage to avoid all the trickery, while showing off your knowledge of the event loop, and arrive at the correct answer, which is _3 getting printed 3 times_. You'll most likely get a follow-up question, 

**How can we fix this?**

The intent of the question is to print numbers from 0 to 2. Again, you wield your knowledge of closures and use an IIFE to wrap the setTimeout callback in a closure, which creates a different `i` for each iteration of the loop.

```javascript
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    setTimeout(((i) => {
        console.log(i);
    })(i), 0);
}
```

Or instead of an IIFE, maybe you solved it by replacing the the arrow function with a regular function and using the `bind` method to bind the `this` to the `i` variable.

```javascript
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    setTimeout((function() {
        console.log(this);
    }).bind(i), 0);
}
```

But here in 2018, there is a simpler alternative. All you have to do is replace the `var` with the new `let` keyword and it works.

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log(i);
    }, 0);
}
```

But wait, how is this even working? Is every iteration of the loop getting a new `i`? If not, `i` would be mutated by every iteration of the loop and the result would be the same value getting printed 3 times. But if every iteration is getting a new `i`, how does it remember the value of `i` from the previous iteration? Is the value somehow getting copied over at the end of each iteration?

The answer is **YES**. in fact, the ECMAScript 2015 specification has a [section](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-for-statement-runtime-semantics-labelledevaluation) dedicated to handling `let` and `const` declarations in a `for` loop (_talk about keeping things simple_). You can contrast it with the [same section](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-12.6.3) ECMAScript 5.1 specification of `for` loops and see how much complexity has been added by use of `let` and `const`.

If you don't mind taking a look at the [spec](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-for-statement-runtime-semantics-labelledevaluation), you can see that during the evaluation of the for loop body, the method `CreatePerIterationEnvironment()` is creating a new lexical environment using `perIterationBindings` for each iteration. 

```
The abstract operation ForBodyEvaluation with arguments ..., perIterationBindings, 
and labelSet is performed as follows:

Let status be CreatePerIterationEnvironment(perIterationBindings).
Repeat
    If test is not [empty], then
        i. Let testRef be the result of evaluating test.
        ii. Let testValue be GetValue(testRef).
        ...
        iv. If ToBoolean(testValue) is false, return NormalCompletion(V).
    ...
    Let status be CreatePerIterationEnvironment(perIterationBindings).
    ...
```


Also, one more thing becomes immediately apparent. The statement `i++` is being executed at the beginning of each iteration (_except the first one ofcourse_). Otherwise, the `i` in the first iteration's environment would have been incremented and the first value to get printed would have been **1**.

Armed with this knowledge, let's try something a little weird. What would be the output of the following code?

```javascript
for (let i = 0, j = setTimeout(() => console.log(i)); i < 3;) {
    i++;
}
```

As per our current understanding, since `i++` is inside the body, it will be executed in the first iteration and and the output would be **1**. Try executing the snippet. 

Uh, oh! The output is **0**. What's happening here? 

Turns out, even before the first iteration, a lexical environment is created for the loop __initiliaztion section__ and copied over to the loop __body evaluation__. If we look at the [specification](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-for-statement-runtime-semantics-labelledevaluation), we can see that the method `NewDeclarativeEnvironment()` at _step 2_ is creating a lexical environment and it is being passed down to the body evaluation at _step 10_.

```
IterationStatement : for ( LexicalDeclaration Expressionopt ; Expressionopt ) Statement

1. Let oldEnv be the running execution contextâ€™s LexicalEnvironment.
2. Let loopEnv be NewDeclarativeEnvironment(oldEnv).
...
4. Let boundNames be the BoundNames of LexicalDeclaration.
...
9. If isConst is false, let perIterationLets be boundNames
10. Let bodyResult be ForBodyEvaluation(..., perIterationLets, ...).
```

You must be thinking, that's a lot of hoops to jump through just to evaluate a loop. But this is necessary because, the semantics of block scoping should seamlessly work with asynchronous calls anywhere in the loop. The good news is that as a programmer, you mostly wouldn't have to worry about any of these. Even with all these complicated semantics, for most practical purposes, it behaves like a `for` loop from any other language.

That's all for this post. Thank you for reading.
